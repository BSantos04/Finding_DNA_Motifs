# Finding_DNA_Motifs
This repository contains a python script that searches for a motif in a FASTA file containing nucleotide biological sequences, displaying all the locations of that specific motif in the sequences.
# Requisities
-Python3
# Instalation
`git clone https://github.com/BSantos04/Finding_DNA_Motifs.git` 
# Tutorial
`python3 {path/to/script.py} {path/to/sequences/file.fasta}`

"Enter the motif you want to find:" `{motif}`
## Path to the Script
Example: `~/Finding_DNA_Motifs/Finding_DNA_Motifs.py` or, if you are already in the working directory, just `Finding_DNA_Motifs.py`.
## Motif 
A DNA sequence containing only IUPAC aminoacids (A, T, C, G) with at least 5 bp length.
